### React Weather App

* Version 1. Works best on mobile.

* Practicing React during Back-End

* Created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

* Built following this tutorial: [Build a Weather App in React JS](https://youtu.be/GuA0_Z1llYU)

* Review: I will absolutely watch more of this developer's videos as his styling, presentation, and pace create the right environment to both learn and be challenged.
